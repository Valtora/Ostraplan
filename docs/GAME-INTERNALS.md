# Ostraplan — Game Internals Reference

Everything Ostraplan has learned about **how Ostranauts works internally**, gathered from decompiling `Assembly-CSharp.dll` and reading the live game data. Ostraplan's promise ("the Law") is met by *porting* this logic, never by referencing the DLL (its types are MonoBehaviours that round-trip through Unity — see [SPEC §2](SPEC.md)). This file is the durable record of that reverse-engineering: consult it when implementing a new law slice, and re-verify it after every game patch.

**Verified against game `0.15.1.6`** (`GameEnv.VerifiedGameVersion`). Rating cutoffs and other magic numbers are hardcoded in the DLL and invisible to data diffing, so they can silently drift — the version pin exists to warn about exactly that.

---

## 1. Regenerating the decompile

The decompiled source is **not** committed (IP hygiene — see [SPEC §13](SPEC.md)). Regenerate on demand (~7 s; `ilspycmd` is an installed global dotnet tool):

```powershell
ilspycmd -p -o <scratch-dir> "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Ostranauts\Ostranauts_Data\Managed\Assembly-CSharp.dll"
```

Line numbers below are approximate (they shift when the game updates) — cite by **`Type.Method`**, which is stable. Key files and members:

| File | Members that matter |
|---|---|
| `Item.cs` | `CheckFit` (placement law), `SetData` (footprint + sprite scale plumbing), `RotateCW`, `SetSpriteSheetIndex` (autotile) |
| `CondTrigger.cs` | `Triggered` (the trigger evaluator — full semantics; CheckFit only reaches a subset) |
| `Loot.cs` | `GetLootNames` (how a socket loot resolves to condition names) |
| `TileUtils.cs` | `RotateTilesCW`, `GetSurroundingTiles`, `PadTilemap`/`TrimTiles`, `GetAirlockBounds` |
| `Ship.cs` | `UpdateTiles` (tile-condition accumulation), `CreateRooms`, `CalculateRating`, `GetTileIndexAtWorldCoords`, `GetRoomSpecs` (all ported — §8) |
| `Room.cs` / `RoomSpec.cs` | `CreateRoomSpecs`, `Matches` (certification — §8) |
| `CondOwner.cs` | `TLTileCoords` (item centre → top-left tile — §8) |

### After a game patch — re-verification checklist
1. Re-decompile; diff `CheckFit`, `SetData`, `RotateCW`, `CalculateRating` (cutoffs), `CreateRooms`, `RoomSpec.Matches` for logic changes.
2. Re-run the test suite — the `GameDataTests` + `ParityTests` (rooms 188/192, certification, rating) assert the real-data facts this file documents; a drift shows up as a parity regression.
3. Bump `GameEnv.VerifiedGameVersion` once green.

## 2. The data model

Game data lives under `…/StreamingAssets/data/<type>/` as JSON arrays of objects keyed by `strName`. Ostraplan resolves the effective data exactly like the game — later-loaded mod object with the same `(type, strName)` replaces the earlier, whole-object (see [SPEC §5.2](SPEC.md)). Field names use Hungarian prefixes (`str`, `n`, `b`, `a`=array, `map`, `json`).

### The palette join (how a build-menu entry becomes a placeable part)

`Installables.dictJobBuildOptions` / `GUIPDA.ShowJobOptions`, mirrored in `Catalog.Build`:

```
data/installables  (strJobType == "install", strBuildType ∈ HULL HVAC POWR SENS CTRL FURN APPS MISC)
        │  strStartInstall
        ▼
data/condowners  ── or via ──▶  data/cooverlays (strCOBase → the real condowner; overlay swaps sprite + friendly name)
        │  strItemDef                                     (~half of the ~330 menu entries are cooverlay skins)
        ▼
data/items  ── geometry: nCols, aSocketAdds/Reqs/Forbids, strImg, bHasSpriteSheet, ctSpriteSheet
```

- `strStartInstall` names the **condowner** to place, resolved directly or through a cooverlay whose `strCOBase` is the real one (`DataHandler.LoadCO`'s fallback).
- State variants are separate menu entries: doors install as `…Open`, beds/appliances as `…Off`.
- A naive `items[strStartInstall]` finds only ~157 of ~330 — you must follow the condowner/cooverlay hop.

---

## 3. Loots & conditions — the tile vocabulary

Everything about placement and rooms is written in **conditions** accumulated on tiles, produced by **loots**.

### Loot mechanics (`Loot.cs`)
- A loot carries `aCOs` (its own payload: `"IsWall=1.0x1"` strings → condition **names**) and `aLoots` (nested loot names).
- `GetLootNames()` flattens `aCOs` cond-names **plus** the recursive expansion of `aLoots`. Socket masks use deterministic single-unit loots (`chance 1.0`, `count 1`), so this is a plain set-union with no randomness. Ostraplan mirrors it in `Catalog.LootConds` (used by `TileConds` accumulation and `CheckFit`).
- `"Blank"` (and any unresolved name) → empty → an **unconstrained** cell.

### Tile-condition accumulation (`Ship.UpdateTiles`, ported as `TileConds`)
Each tile holds a condition multiset (`Tile.coProps`). On place/remove, **every overlapping part** adds/subtracts its per-cell `aSocketAdds` loot's conditions (±1). Presence means "count > 0". State variants (door Open vs Closed) are *different item defs with different adds* — Ostraplan places the `strStartInstall` def, exactly as the game's installer does.

### The `TIL*` loot table (verified from `data/loot`)

Adds loots (what a part contributes to its own footprint tiles):

| Loot | Expands to |
|---|---|
| `TILFloor` | `IsFloor`, `IsFloorSealed` |
| `TILWallAdds` | `IsObstruction`, `IsWall` |
| `TILFixtureAdds` | `IsFixture`, `IsObstruction` |
| `TILExtFixtureAdds` | `IsFixture`, `IsFixtureExt`, `IsObstruction`, `IsWallDeco` |
| `TILSubfloorAdds` | `IsSubTile` *(walkable sub-floor — under-floor storage, no solid body)* |
| `TIL2DeckAdds` | `IsFixture`, `IsSubTile`, `IsObstruction` *(the visible tank body — above-floor)* |
| `TILPowerConduit` | `IsPowerConduit`, `IsPowerPath` |
| `TILPowerFixtureAdds` | `IsFixture`, `IsObstruction`, `IsPowerPath` |

Req/forbid loots (what a cell tests for) — same expansion, different intent:

| Loot | Expands to | Used as |
|---|---|---|
| `TILFloor` | `IsFloor`, `IsFloorSealed` | **req**: both must be present |
| `TILWall` | `IsWall` | **req** |
| `TILObstruction` | `IsFixture`, `IsFixtureExt`, `IsObstruction`, `IsItemTile`, `IsFloorFlex` | **forbid**: fail if *any* present |
| `TILSubfloorForbids` | `IsSubTile` | **forbid** |
| `TIL2DeckForbids` | `IsFixture`, `IsSubTile`, `IsObstruction`, `IsItemTile`, `IsWallDeco`, `IsFloorFlex` | **forbid** |

Condition vocabulary that drives Ostraplan's own logic: `IsFloor`/`IsFloorSealed`/`IsFloorFlex` (floor), `IsWall`/`IsPortal` (walls & doors), `IsObstruction` (solid/blocking), `IsFixture` (furniture/appliances), `IsSubTile` (sub-floor), `IsPowerConduit` (thin power runs), `IsDockSys`/`IsInstalled` (docking ports).

---

## 4. Footprints vs sprites — **two different sizes** (a core gotcha)

The game keeps two independent sizes for an item, and Ostraplan must not conflate them:

| Size | Formula | Source | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Socket / placement grid** | `nWidthInTiles × nHeightInTiles` = `nCols × (aSocketAdds.Count / nCols)` | `Item.SetData` (≈L424-425) | CheckFit, ghost/selection extent, tile accumulation |
| **Visual sprite size** | `vScale = round(texturePx / 16)` tiles, min 1 | `Item.SetData` (≈L438-439) | how big the sprite is drawn (centered on the footprint) |

For most parts these are equal (a 1×1 wall = 16×16 px; a 3×5 bed = 48×80 px). **The large fuel tanks are where they diverge** and it's not a data error:

- `ItmCanisterLH02` (D2O), `ItmCanisterLHe01/02` (He3): `nCols = 7`, 49 adds → **7×7 socket grid**, but a **48×48 px = 3×3 sprite**.
- The socket grid is an **abstraction of sub-floor storage**: the outer ring adds `TILSubfloorAdds` (walkable sub-floor), only the **center 3×3** adds `TIL2DeckAdds` (the solid, visible tank). `aSocketReqs` is `TILFloor` across the whole inner 7×7 — the game genuinely needs a **7×7 sealed-floor pad** to place one.

**Ostraplan's rule:** render the sprite at its own `vScale` size, centered on the footprint (`SpriteCache.SpriteTiles` + `ShipCanvas.DrawSprite`); **keep the footprint at the 7×7 socket grid** for CheckFit/selection. Shrinking the footprint to 3×3 would let Ostraplan place a tank in a gap the game refuses — a **Law false positive**, the cardinal sin. So a tank *looks* 3×3 but still reserves its true 7×7 pad, matching the game's own 7×7 build grid.

The build ghost distinguishes the two footprints (`Catalog.IsUnderFloorLoot`: a cell is **under-floor** when its adds mark `IsSubTile` **without** `IsObstruction`): the sub-floor ring is shaded apart with a dashed reservation outline, and the solid green/red validity outline hugs the above-floor body. Once *placed*, the game just shows the 3×3 tank on plain (walkable) floor, so Ostraplan does too.

---

## 5. Placement law — `Item.CheckFit` (P1, ported)

Ported to `Ostraplan.Core/CheckFit.cs`. For a candidate `(part, anchor, rotation)`:

1. **Ring grid.** `aSocketReqs` / `aSocketForbids` are per-cell loot names over the **(W+2)×(H+2) ring** (footprint + 1-tile border), row-major, border included. `aSocketAdds` covers only the W×H footprint. Ring cell `(r,c)` → world tile `(anchorX-1+c, anchorY-1+r)`.
2. **Cell test — PRESENCE ONLY.** CheckFit builds a *throwaway* `CondTrigger { aReqs = reqLoot.GetLootNames(), aForbids = forbidLoot.GetLootNames() }` (default `bAND = true`) and calls `Triggered`. Because these are trivial triggers of condition names, only the presence path runs: **every req condition present (count > 0), no forbid condition present**. The full `CondTrigger.Triggered` machinery — count multiplicity, nested `aTriggers`, `bAND = false` OR-logic, `strHigherCond`/`aLowerConds`, `fChance` — is **unreachable from placement** and is deferred to P2 (room certification). Ostraplan does *not* route through a general trigger evaluator here; it expands the loots and checks presence directly, leaving autotile's presence-only `TileConds.Triggered` untouched.
3. **Off-ship rule.** A ring cell with no accumulated conditions (empty space) **passes iff it has no requirement** — this is how "must attach to structure / needs floor beneath" is encoded. (An existing-but-empty tile behaves identically, so Ostraplan treats "no conds" uniformly.)
4. **Rotation.** 90° steps rotate the req/forbid ring masks and the adds mask. `GridMath.Rotate(cells, W+2, H+2, rot)` reproduces `TileUtils.RotateTilesCW(cells, W+2)` **exactly** (verified). **Sheet items (walls/floors, `bHasSpriteSheet`) never rotate** — `Item.RotateCW` returns early for them.
5. **Airlock envelope.** For each installed docking port, `DockA→DockB` defines a mating face; **no ring cell may fall beyond it**. The game bounds only `aDocksys.FirstOrDefault()`; Ostraplan bounds **all ports, ring-inclusive** — provably never allows what the game refuses (refusing a superset can't create a false positive), and identical to the game on the single-port ships that are the norm. Face math is `ProblemScan.TryGetFace` (see §7).
6. **Self-exclusion (re-validation).** When re-checking an *already-placed* part, its own tile contribution must be subtracted first — walls/fixtures add `IsObstruction` **and** forbid `TILObstruction` on their own footprint, so they fail against themselves otherwise. `CheckFit.Check` takes an optional `self` placement for this; the flagging scan (`ProblemScan`) uses it, live placement checks don't (the candidate isn't applied yet).
7. **Excluded by design** (in-game-only predicates that cannot exist in a planner): crew proximity/LOS (`GUIInventory.instance.Selected` + `Visibility.IsCondOwnerLOSVisible`), docked-ship `TileUtils.WouldConnectShips`, and station-*build* zone permission (whether a tile is buildable on a station). Note this is the placement-law exclusion only — ship **zones as data** (`JsonZone`/`aZones`) are modelled and round-tripped (`ShipZone`/`ZoneGeometry`; see SPEC §6.10), just not treated as a build constraint.

> **Floor fixtures are buildable surfaces.** The common `TILObstruction` forbid mask expands to `IsFixture` + `IsFixtureExt` + `IsObstruction` + `IsItemTile` + `IsFloorFlex`. But an under-floor storage bin / rack (`ItmRackUnder01`, `ItmStorageBinFloor…`) tags its walkable tiles `IsFloorSealed` + `IsFixture` (via `TILFloorFixture`) and **never** `IsObstruction`, and the game lets you build on — and reach an adjacent fixture across — that floor. So `CheckFit.CellPasses` does **not** let `IsFixture` trip the forbid on a tile that carries `IsFloorSealed`; a genuine `IsObstruction` still blocks. (Ground-truthed against in-game placement — the raw mask alone over-flags a rack whose access tile sits on a floor bin.)

### Enforcement & flagging (Ostraplan's P1 UX decisions)
- **New placement is hard-blocked** at the single choke point `ShipCanvas.TryPlacePose` (covers click, drag-paint, box/hollow fill, symmetry mirrors — each mirror judged independently). Illegal cells are silently skipped.
- **Moves / rotations / duplicates into an illegal spot are allowed but flagged** (deletes always allowed + flagged). `ProblemScan` re-checks every placed part (self-excluded), groups blocking problems by reason, and hazard-tints the offending tiles; the ghost shows green/red with per-cell failures and a reason in the status bar.
- **Constructibility pass** (warn-only): re-simulate a canonical floors→walls→rest build order with incremental CheckFit; warn naming the first part that never becomes placeable. Runs only when the finished design is otherwise legal (locked ship-givens seeded first).

### Worked examples (real data, asserted in `GameDataTests`)
- **`ItmWall1x1`** — 1×1, `aSocketReqs` all Blank (free-standing, like the game), center forbid `TILObstruction` (won't stack on an obstruction). Sheet item (`ctSpriteSheet = TIsWall`).
- **`ItmBed01Off`** — 3×5. Reqs: `TILFloor` across the footprint + `TILWall` down the **right** border (the headboard). Forbids: `TILObstruction` on the footprint **and** the left border. Adds `TILFixtureAdds` (so it forbids the obstruction it will itself add — see self-exclusion).
- **`ItmCanisterLH02`** — 7×7 socket grid, 3×3 sprite (§4).
- **`ItmDockSys03Closed`** — the buildable "Secondary Exterior Airlock", 7×2, free-standing (all-Blank reqs).

---

## 6. Rendering

- **Z-order.** `nLayer` is `0` for **every** item in the data — the game does not layer items by `nLayer`; it Y-sorts sprites over a separate floor tile-layer. Ostraplan's single-pass renderer instead ranks each part by the conditions it contributes (`Catalog.RenderLayer`, memoized): **floor** (`IsFloor`/`IsFloorSealed`/`IsFloorFlex`) < **wall/door** (`IsWall`/`IsPortal`, checked first — a door also seals floor) < **fixtures & the rest** < **power conduit** (`IsPowerConduit`, thin runs on top). `ShipDocument.DrawOrder` sorts by rank, then `nLayer`, then Y, then insertion. Hit-testing returns the topmost layer; `HitTestStack` (reverse draw order) drives the right-click layer picker for reaching buried parts.
- **Sprite draw.** Non-sheet sprites draw at `vScale` size centered on the footprint (§4). Sheet items draw per-tile.
- **Autotiling** (`Item.SetSpriteSheetIndex`, ported in `Autotile.cs`). Sheet items (`bHasSpriteSheet` + `ctSpriteSheet`) pick a sheet cell from the 4 cardinal neighbours whose tile conds trigger `ctSpriteSheet`: mask bits **N=8, W=4, E=2, S=1** → the fixed 16-entry `Item.SpriteSheetIndices` table → a cell index whose **rows count from the texture bottom** (Unity UV origin; WPF flips the row). Core wall sheet is 64×64 = a 4×4 grid of 16 px tiles. These constants are exact ports — do not "fix" them.

---

## 7. Docking & airlocks

- A ship needs **≥1 installed docksys** or it can never hard-dock (`Ship.aDocksys` collects COs that trigger `TIsDockSysInstalled`; 42 core templates have none — no crash, just unmateable). Ostraplan surfaces a standing "no docking port" problem.
- `TIsDockSysInstalled` reqs are `[IsDockSys, IsInstalled]` and **all** must match. Matching *any* (via `IsInstalled`) flags every installed part — a real bug that shipped once; `ProblemScan.IsDocksys` requires all reqs and is regression-tested.
- **No rule ties an airlock to (0,0)** — 0 of 147 core templates place one at the origin, and the Babak has two. The "primary" (`Ship.PrimaryDockingPortID`) is a runtime-cyclable selection defaulting to the first port. Ostraplan's **Primary Airlock convention** is a UI simplification: `ItmDockSys02Closed` (`IsIndestructable`, `IsShipSpecialItem`, no install job) resolves for documents but stays out of the palette; every doc owns exactly one, seeded at the origin and locked (`ShipDocument.IsLocked`). The buildable one is the **Secondary** (`ItmDockSys03Closed`).
- **The one real positional rule: no construction beyond an airlock's mating face.** `TileUtils.GetAirlockBounds` returns a bounding box `(min, max)` where each installed port sets **exactly one** component in the direction it faces (`DockB.y>0.5 → max.y`, `<−0.5 → min.y`, `x>0.5 → max.x`, `<−0.5 → min.x`), leaving the other three at ±∞ — so a single port is a **half-plane** (facing axis bounded, perpendicular axis unbounded), from its `DockA→DockB` arrow (condowner `mapPoints`, px around the item centre, **+y up**; `DockA` at the door, `DockB` outside the hull), face at `DockA ± |arrow|/2`. Ported in `ProblemScan.TryGetFace` (verified: the face lands on the port's footprint edge); rendered as red hazard stripes and enforced as a CheckFit bound (§5.5). **Coordinate note:** game is y-up, Ostraplan docs y-down; conversions handled at the boundary (`ProblemScan.Transform`).
- **The bound (like all of CheckFit) applies to NEW construction only — the game never re-validates existing hull.** A real ship legally has structure that a from-scratch build order + these bounds would refuse (e.g. hull baked beyond where a later-added airlock's face falls); the game doesn't care because it was already there. So Ostraplan must **not** re-validate *imported* structure against the placement law — imported parts are marked **given** (`Placement.IsGiven`) and skipped by `ProblemScan` (legality re-check, envelope, constructibility base). Moving/rotating a given part clears the flag (an edit is new construction). Found when the valid Charon flagged 84+ false positives on import.

- **Buying a ship at a broker docks it AT PURCHASE TIME, and the ship must expose its ports while SHALLOW.** Both broker paths spawn the for-sale ship `Ship.Loaded.Shallow` at the template's baked `objSS`, hidden and undocked (`Trader.AddNewShips` for the regular list, `GUIShipBroker.AddSpecialOfferShip` for the Special Offer). On Buy, `GUIShipBroker.OnPurchaseConfirm` transfers ownership then docks it to the broker's station: `CrewSim.DockShip` when the station is deep-loaded (re-spawns the ship `Full`, so `Ship.AddCO` rebuilds `aDockingPorts` from the items), but `shipByRegID.Dock(station)` on the **shallow** branch (`station.LoadState <= Shallow`) — which docks the still-shallow ship without a full re-spawn. A shallow ship reads its ports **only** from `json.aDockingPorts` (`Ship` load sets `aDockingPorts = json.aDockingPorts`; only the `>= Edit` path `Clear()`s and rebuilds them from items). If a dock fails for any reason (`GetAvailableDockingPorts` finds no mate, or the shallow ship exposes no ports) the game does **not** reposition the ship — it is left at its `objSS`, and a ship far from the ATC also drops out of the P.A.S.S. ferry list (`GUIPDAFerry.ShowRequest` distance filter). **So a `data/ships` export must bake `aDockingPorts` (installed docksys item strIDs, primary/non-TypeB first, TypeB last) + `strPrimaryDockingPortID`** — core templates carry them; omitting them stranded a purchased Ostraplan ship at ~1.85 AU, undocked and un-ferriable. `ItmDockSys02Closed`/`ItmDockSys03Closed` both carry `IsDockSys`+`IsInstalled`+`IsShipSpecialItem` (so both register); `02` is non-TypeB (the primary), `03` is TypeB.

## 8. P2 · P3 subsystems — **ported (rooms · certification · rating · interop)**

Ported to `Ostraplan.Core` (`ShipGrid`, `ShipTemplate`, `PartResolver`, `Rooms`, `CondEval`, `RoomSpecs`, `Rating`, `ShipAnalysis`) and validated parity-first against the game's baked `aRooms`/`aRating` (`ParityTests`).

### Coordinate model (the loader, verified 622/622 walls on the Babak)
An `aItems` entry's `(fX,fY)` is its footprint **centre** (`CondOwner.TLTileCoords`): top-left tile world = `(fX − (W/2 − 0.5), fY + (H/2 − 0.5))` using the **rotated** W×H; tile `(col,row)` with `col = round(worldX − vShipPos.x)`, `row = −round(worldY − vShipPos.y)`; index `col + row·nCols`. **`fRotation` is CCW** (Unity Z-euler); `GridMath.Rotate` is CW, so the loader **negates** (`ShipGrid.ToRot`) — CW misplaces the asymmetric 90/270 socket patterns. Only top-level `aItems` are placed on the grid; contained/slotted items (`strParentID`/`strSlotParentID`) are not (they carry no wall/floor conds, so they never corrupt the fill).

### Rooms & airtightness — `Ship.CreateRooms` (`RoomBuilder.Build`)
BFS flood fill, **4-connectivity** (N/W/E/S). **`IsWall` is the only flood boundary.** Portals never seed. A **door** is a 5×1 item — `[wall, wall, portal, wall, wall]` — whose four side cells are always `IsWall` (they seal the doorway into the wall line, open *or* closed); only its **centre** cell differs by state: **open** (`TILPortalOpen` → `IsPortal`, no `IsWall`) is a walkable portal that flood-*sinks* into the first room reaching it and never expands, while **closed** (`TILPortalClosedStuck` → `IsPortal`+`IsWall`) is a hard fill boundary. Either way the door splits the hull into the **same two rooms** with the **same** airtightness — door state is cosmetic to the room/rating law. The centre tile is then filed into a compartment: an open one is already claimed by the fill; a closed one is assigned by `AssignPortals` to a **non-void cardinal-neighbour room** (never the exterior — a floored doorway must not read as a hull breach). A room is **Void** if any member tile lacks `IsFloorSealed` **or** a cardinal neighbour is off-grid (also **Outside**/`bOuter`); Void is fixed during the fill, so a door tile added afterward never voids a sealed room. Volume `0.25599998 × tileCount`.
- **`AssignPortals` is geometry-based, not map-point.** The game files a door across its `RoomA`/`RoomB` face; for a straight door those are just the two cardinal neighbours perpendicular to it, so a non-void-neighbour assignment reproduces it **without the door's world centre** — which a live document doesn't carry (`FromDocument` parts sit at CX/CY 0, so the old world-point lookup dumped a closed door into the exterior and raised a false open-to-space breach). Since a door tile's filing changes no compartment, certification, or rating, the parity comparison still excludes portal tiles.
- **Exterior rooming is asymmetric/trim-dependent** (the game leaves the far empty margin around a small ship unroomed — bounded by `TrimTiles`, not a clean bbox; the recomputed Void/Outside room over-claims it). Harmless: the Outside room is Blank and never counts toward the rating. Parity is lenient on exterior-void over-claim; interior compartments must match exactly.

### Room certification — `RoomSpec.Matches` (`RoomCertifier`, `CondEval`)
Certifies as the highest-`nPriority` spec that matches, else `Blank`. Matches iff `bAllowVoid == room.Void`, tile count in `[nMinTileSize, nMaxTileSize]` (−1 = unbounded), no member fires any `aForbids`, every `aReqs` satisfied **with multiplicity** (`"TIsChairInstalled=1.0x4"` → 4; each match consumes `StackCount`, always 1 for a planner). Floor-grate members (`IsFloorGrate`) skipped; only installed parts count, each joining the room at its **anchor (centre) tile**. Reqs/forbids are **condtrigger names** evaluated against the part's `aStartingConds` set by the ported `CondTrigger.Triggered` — the bAND path (reqs/forbids/nested `aTriggers`) and the `bAND=false` OR path (`aTriggersForbid`, then any req / `aTrigger`; e.g. `TIsRoomCargo` = OR of storage-bin/rack). `fChance`/`strHigherCond` are unreachable from room specs → deterministic safe-pass + logged note.

### Ship Rating — `Ship.CalculateRating` (`Rating`)
Six slots, cutoffs hardcoded in the DLL (unit-pinned): **condition** A–E (pristine planner ⇒ A); **non-Blank room count**; **maneuver** `mass/fRCSCount` (fRCSCount = Σ `StatThrustStrength` over installed RCS clusters via `TIsRCSClusterAudioEmitter`; mass = Σ `StatMass`; 0 RCS → O); **size class** by `nCols·nRows`.

**Operational-state build default (`Catalog.PreferPoweredState`).** The game installs most powered devices in their **Off** state (`strStartInstall` = `Itm…Off`, carrying `IsOff`) — the state a rating never counts (rating triggers forbid `IsOff`; `TIsRCSClusterAudioEmitter` is one) and that a player switches on after loading. Ostraplan builds the **operational counterpart** instead so a design's rating is meaningful and an export spawns working. The game's on-state naming isn't uniform, so the counterpart is found by trying `…On` (cooler, switch), `…OnG` (the green/normal state pumps and most alarms use), then dropping `Off` (RCS, heater, bed), accepting only a candidate that resolves, isn't itself `IsOff`, and shares the footprint. ~58 of ~63 install-Off palette devices pair cleanly; the rest (colour/alert alarms, transponder, the reactor's startup `Ignition`, open/closed vents) are ambiguous and left as installed.

### The parity gate — the ground-truth reality
The corpus is **192 core ship objects** (files are top-level arrays; the ship is an element with `nCols`+`aItems`; ~a dozen files are non-ship). **All 192 carry baked `aRooms`** (roomSpec + bVoid + tile sets) → a 192-ship rooms **and** certification gate. **Only Babak / Babak Refit carry `aRating`** (both damaged derelicts; the Refit's rating is a verbatim stale copy of the base ship, from before it grew) → rating is size-slot parity on the base Babak + unit-tested cutoffs.
- **Rooms parity: 188/192** (4 named exclusions: malformed Coffin, two aero slant-wall hulls, one interceptor airlock).
- **Certification: 2109/2148 rooms exact, 0 over-certifications of a real compartment.** The 39 diffs are two documented corpus-only artifacts: **contained/slotted cargo** the top-level `aItems` loader can't count (the game reaches it via `GetCOs bSubObjects` → under-certification), and the exterior over-claim (CargoRoomExterior on the unbounded Outside room). Neither reaches an Ostraplan-authored design (no sub-objects, bounded interior).

### P3 interop — export & import (`ShipExport`, `TemplateImport`, `SaveImport`)

**The `data/ships` file (`JsonShip`).** A ship file is a **top-level array** of ship objects. The game (de)serializes with **Newtonsoft** — proven by `Dictionary<string,string>` fields (`aDocked`, `aMarketConfigs`) that Unity's `JsonUtility` can't handle — so **missing fields default and unknown fields are ignored**. Export therefore writes a *strict superset* of a real template that loads cleanly. The "well-formed" set = the **54 top-level fields present on all 192 core templates** (surveyed) + `aRating`; unlisted DTO fields are safely omitted. Values are pristine/neutral (all wear/mass/physics caches 0 — the game recomputes on full load), `origin`/`publicName` = `"$TEMPLATE"`, `nConstructionProgress` 100. `strRegID` must be non-empty (the loader indexes `strRegID[0]`), but the game **regenerates it** and **re-derives `origin`** from a loot table when `origin == "$TEMPLATE"` (`Ship` load), and null-guards `aCrew`/`aCOs` — so a template needs no crew/cargo. `shipCO` is a minimal `ShipCO` with `aConds` = the three `Stat*ProgressMax=1.0x1000` + `DEFAULT`.

**`aItems` entry** = `strName`, `fX`, `fY`, `fRotation`, `strID` for authored parts. Extras appear for: `strParentID`/`strSlotParentID` (contained/slotted sub-objects), `aGPMSettings` (device settings), `aCondOverrides` (per-instance conds), `bForceLoad`. Export writes fresh `Guid` `strID`s and omits `aGPMSettings` (devices default from their def).

**Contained cargo is exported the way a SAVE stores it** (the only way a template keeps it faithfully). A `data/ships` file spawns as a template (`bTemplateOnly`), and decompiled `Ship.SpawnItems` / `Container` / `CondOwner.PostGameLoad` show:
- A parented item is **dropped** unless it has `aCondOverrides` (which also flags its **root container** so `bLoot` is cleared and the container is *not* refilled from its default loot) **or** `bForceLoad` (which keeps the item's `strID` instead of assigning a fresh one). Without this a template comes back empty (racks/bays) or with only the def's loadout (a weapon's default ammo, "not all" the authored rounds).
- A **stack** is rebuilt only from the stack-head CO's `aStack` (a `string[]` of member `strID`s) in `PostGameLoad` — templates carry no `aCOs`, so core templates re-roll ammo from default loot and their baked lead+members chain is vestigial. A bare lead+members chain in an export orphaned the members (a member parents a non-container lead, so it hits neither the slot nor container branch of `SpawnItems`) and collapsed the stack toward a single.

So export gives every contained/slotted item **both** `bForceLoad: true` (keep `strID`) **and** an `aCondOverrides` marker (survive + suppress the container's default loot — a benign `StatDamage=0`, Amount 0 = undamaged, which is also the non-null array the pre-pass tests), **and** bakes a save-style **`aCOs`** entry per contained item (`aConds:["DEFAULT"]` repopulates the def's pristine conds; `inventoryX/Y` from the grid cell). A stack head's CO carries `aStack` = its member `strID`s (the head adds itself in `PostGameLoad`, so `aStack` lists members only). Top-level parts need none of this (the loader keeps them unconditionally, and they get no CO — matching a core template). Nav-console modules Ostraplan injects into an empty console are baked the same way. `aCOs` is omitted entirely when a design has no cargo.

**The coordinate inverse (export) / forward (import).** With export `vShipPos = (0,0)` the two offset terms of the loader math (§8 coordinate model) vanish, so for a grid part at top-left `(col,row)` with rotated footprint `(wr,hr)` and Ostraplan rotation `Rot`: `fX = col + (wr/2 − 0.5)`, `fY = −(row + (hr/2 − 0.5))`, `fRotation = Norm(−Rot)` (back to CCW; only 90↔270 differ). Import applies the same mapping forward via the shared `ShipGrid.TemplateTile`. A round-trip (`doc → export → parse → FromTemplate`) reproduces the same tiles/rooms/rating exactly, so the game's full-load recompute matches the baked `aRooms`/`aRating` (no visible rating change on load). `aRooms` = each room's tile indices (`col + row·nCols`, same 0-based grid) + `bVoid` + `roomSpec` + `roomValue` (the **parts** value `Room.CalculateRoomValue` sums — `Σ GetBasePrice()×fValueModifier`, i.e. `Σ base×1.25(pristine)×roomModifier`, which `GetShipValue` reads on a shallow load — **not** the physical `Volume`).

**Non-buildable defs.** ~half of a real ship's distinct top-level defs are **not** in the buildable palette (raw hull, `Compartment`, RCS clusters, sensors) but all resolve to geometry via the condowner→`strItemDef` hop. `Catalog.Lookup` resolves *any* placed def on demand (shared `ResolveDef` with the palette build, so overlay-skin sprite + friendly name are correct), category "—", out of the palette but rendered/analysed. Empirically every placed def across sampled ships resolves to an existing sprite (no magenta-"Missing" clutter).

**Save games.** A save is a **folder** with `<name>.zip` + `saveInfo.json` (+ portrait/screenshot). Inside the zip: `ships/<RegID>.json` (one per ship in the loaded neighbourhood — dozens to ~140), a `<playerName>.json` character record, and copies of `saveInfo`/portrait/screenshot. The **player's ship** is `strShip` on that character record (a RegID). Do **not** match `saveInfo.shipName` — it's a renamed **display** name (`publicName`, e.g. "Charon") that matches no ship's `strName` (which is the RegID or stock model name). Save ships are the same `JsonShip` schema (a superset of a template), so import reads only the top-level layout and drops all runtime state for free.

## 9. Gotcha index (quick reference)

- **`nLayer` is always 0** — never layer by it; rank by contributed conditions (§6).
- **Footprint ≠ sprite** — socket grid vs `vScale`; the tanks are 7×7 footprint / 3×3 sprite (§4). Keep the footprint for the Law.
- **CheckFit is presence-only** — don't over-build the trigger evaluator for P1 (§5.2).
- **Self-exclusion** — re-validating a placed part must lift its own conds first (§5.6).
- **Envelope uses `aDocksys[0]` in-game** — Ostraplan uses all ports (safe over-approximation) (§5.5).
- **`TIsDockSysInstalled` needs ALL reqs** — an any-match flags every installed part (§7).
- **Loot payload is `aCOs`, not `aLoots`** — `aLoots` nests further loots (§3).
- **Palette join hops through condowner/cooverlay** — `items[strStartInstall]` alone misses ~half (§2).
- **Autotile rows count from the texture bottom** — WPF flips them; the mask is N8/W4/E2/S1 (§6).
- **Autotile connectivity honours `bAND`** — `TIsWall` is one AND req (`IsWall`), but `TIsConduitSprite` is `bAND=false`, an **OR** of `IsPowerConduit`/`IsPowerSwitch`/`IsPowerJack`; a conduit connects to *any* of them. `TileConds.Triggered` must respect `bAND` (AND-only made every conduit render as an isolated junction). Nested sheet triggers defer to `CondEval` (§6).
- **`loading_order.json` is fragile** — top-level array only; Ostraplan reads it, never writes it (registration stays with ModTools/Ostrasort).
- **Game is y-up, Ostraplan docs are y-down** — convert at the boundary (§7).
- **`fRotation` is CCW; `GridMath.Rotate` is CW** — the template loader negates (§8). Only 90/270 items differ.
- **Item `(fX,fY)` is the footprint CENTRE, not a corner** — top-left via `TLTileCoords = (x−(W/2−0.5), y+(H/2−0.5))` (§8).
- **Only `IsWall` bounds the room fill** — a door's side cells are always `IsWall`; its centre is a walkable portal when open (flood-sinks) and an `IsWall` boundary when closed. Same two rooms either way — door state is cosmetic to the rooms/rating; a closed door's centre is filed by `AssignPortals` to a non-void neighbour, never the exterior (§8).
- **Ship files are top-level arrays** — the ship is an element with `nCols`+`aItems`; skip non-ship files. Only ~2 carry `aRating`; all carry `aRooms` (§8).
- **Room certification tests CondOwner conds, not tile conds** — `room.aCos` `aStartingConds`, evaluated by `CondEval`; multiplicity is the spec's `xN` (§8).
- **Contained/slotted cargo isn't counted** — top-level `aItems` only; the game reaches sub-objects via `bSubObjects`, so cargo-laden templates under-certify (corpus-only) (§8). Import **drops** these (`strParentID`/`strSlotParentID`) — layout only.
- **Contained cargo is exported save-style** — a template keeps parented items only with `aCondOverrides` (survive + clear the root container's `bLoot`) **and** `bForceLoad` (keep `strID`), and rebuilds a stack only from the head CO's `aStack`; so export bakes both flags + an `aCOs` block, with `aStack` (member ids) on stack heads (§8).
- **A save's player ship is `strShip`, not `saveInfo.shipName`** — the latter is the renamed `publicName` and matches no `strName`; read the character record's `strShip` RegID (§8).
- **`JsonShip` is Newtonsoft, tolerant** — export writes a superset of the 54 universal template fields; missing default, unknown ignored. Export anchors at `vShipPos (0,0)` so the coordinate inverse drops its offset terms (§8).
- **Import must resolve non-buildable defs** — the palette is buildable-only, but ~half a real ship isn't; go through `Catalog.Lookup`, never `ByDefName` alone, for any placed def (§8).
- **The placement law is construction-time only** — the game never re-validates existing structure, so don't flag *imported* parts (`IsGiven`); a valid real ship stacks parts (fixtures on floors, thrusters through walls) whose mutual forbids a final-state re-check trips. Only user edits (new/moved parts) are validated (§7).
- **Filter `IsSystem` on import** — loot spawners, fire, explosions carry `IsSystem` and resolve to geometry but are runtime effects, not buildable structure (no `Sys*` def is installable); drop them (75 on the Charon) or they import as phantom parts and export into templates (§8).
- **`publicName` sticks, `strRegID` doesn't, and `objSS (0,0)` is inside the sun** (`Ship.InitShip` / `StarSystem.SpawnShip`, decompile-verified). On a template spawn: `publicName` is re-rolled to a random `DataHandler.GetShipName()` **only** when the on-disk value is `null`/`""`/`"$TEMPLATE"` — any other string survives and is the name shown at the transponder/comms/broker/rating UI, so export writes a real name (not `"$TEMPLATE"`). `strRegID` is **never read** from the file — `StarSystem.SpawnShip` overwrites `jsonShip.strRegID` with a caller-minted ID before `InitShip` runs, unconditionally (RegIDs must be unique in `dictShips`), so a "custom callsign" can't be baked in. `origin=="$TEMPLATE"` (literal check) triggers a `TXTShipOrigin*` loot re-roll; anything else is kept. And `objSS` must be **small-nonzero**, never exact `(0,0)`: the loot-spawn path (kiosk/Special-Offer/starting-ship) doesn't reposition a template like import does, and `(0,0)` around "Sol" is the star's own origin.
- **Bake `aDockingPorts` + `strPrimaryDockingPortID` or a bought ship never docks** (§7, decompile-verified). Buying at a broker docks the ship at purchase time (`GUIShipBroker.OnPurchaseConfirm` → `CrewSim.DockShip`/`Ship.Dock`), but on the shallow-station branch the ship is docked while still `Shallow`-loaded, and a shallow ship's open ports come **only** from `json.aDockingPorts` (the game rebuilds them from items only on a `>= Edit` load, which `Clear()`s then re-registers via `Ship.AddCO`). Omitting them left a purchased export with zero open ports → `Dock` fails → the ship is never repositioned and sits at its `objSS` (~1.85 AU away, undocked, and dropped from the P.A.S.S. ferry list by the `GUIPDAFerry` distance filter). Export bakes the installed docksys item strIDs (primary/non-TypeB first, TypeB last; `ItmDockSys02Closed` is the non-TypeB primary, `ItmDockSys03Closed` is TypeB) and points `strPrimaryDockingPortID` at the primary. Fixed in 0.14.2.
- **A Special Offer ship always lists at "$0" — by game design, not a pricing bug** (`UsedShipListEntry.SetSpecialOfferData` hardcodes `txtPrice.text = "$ 0"`, the only hardcoded-zero price in the broker code). The DTO still carries the real `Ship.GetShipValue() × priceModifier`, so the **Confirm Transaction** dialog (`ConfirmBuyShipPopup`) shows the true price and the sale charges it. Regular vendor ships (`GUIShipBroker.AddPurchasableShip`) instead show `GetShipValue() × priceModifier` live in the list. So a freshly-spawned export in the `RandomShipBrokerSpecialOffer` slot reads "$0" in the list with a correct confirm price — a real list price needs a **regular broker kiosk** pool, not the special-offer slot. `fLastQuotedPrice` is a red herring: neither buy path reads it (only the SELL/DERELICTS `GetQuotedPrice` cache does), and it's reset to 0 on a non-derelict Edit-load — baking it changes nothing. The correct confirm price also **proves export's baked `aRooms[].roomValue` is right** (a Shallow load reads it via `Ship.GetShipValue` → `Σ jsonRoom.roomValue`, `×3` if `nO2PumpCount > 0`).
- **A ship broker's `aCOs` is one weighted string, not a list** — `RandomShipBroker*`/`CGEncShipbreakerShipEvents` pools carry a **single** `aCOs` element that is a `|`-delimited `Name=WeightxCount` set from which the game picks **one**. Add a ship by appending `|Name=Wx1` to that string (`LootList.Append`), never a second array element (which rolls a second ship). Special-Offer pools are one pinned `Name=1.0x1`. A starting ship reuses the `CGEncShipSalvagePod*` chain: career `aEventsShip` → the loot pool → an `…Intro` that is **both** a lifeevent (`strInteraction`=itself, `strShipRewards`→a ship-type loot) **and** an interaction (`aInverse` choices); "Take" grants the ship via `strShipRewards` and starting gear via `aLootItms:["addus,ItmShipbreakerLoadout"]`. Vanilla has **no** true chargen ship-picker — it's weighted-random.
